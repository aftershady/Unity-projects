# Unity-projects

This repository is dedicated to my personal journey of learning Unity and game development.

It will primarily host small experimental games (mini-games) designed to help me build the necessary skills to eventually create and publish my own complete games — and hopefully sell them!

## 📁 Current Projects

- **2D Learning Project**
  A simple 2D platformer inspired by classic Mario-style gameplay.
  Focuses on basic movement, collision, level design, and player control.

- **Project Test Sandbox**
  A 3D sandbox scene used to experiment with interactions, physics, and gameplay mechanics in a free-form environment.

## 🚧 What to Expect

- Small prototypes and experimental mechanics
- Mostly 2D or basic 3D Unity projects
- Frequent iteration and experimentation
- Code, assets, and scenes created for practice and learning
